I am a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Quantitative Methods at [CUNEF Universidad](https://www.cunef.edu/en/).

My research explores the development of Bayesian statistical methods, with a focus on both theoretical foundations and computational techniques to address challenges in modern data analysis.

I recently defended my PhD thesis "[_Bayesian Reduced-Rank Regression_](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/108576)" at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), supervised by [Alex Shestopaloff](https://utstat.utoronto.ca/~alexander/), [Luca Rossini](https://rossiniluca.github.io/web/) and [Matteo Iacopini](https://matteoiacopini.github.io/).
